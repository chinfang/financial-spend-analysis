### Models and Techniques
Graph database: [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com)
Visualization: [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com)

### Analysis and Results
We first have a general view of the transaction period to each supplier. The figure shows that some of the expense types 
have lots of variation in transaction period of each supplier, while some of the expense types have very consistent transaction
period. The result represents that each supplier has very different transaction period.
